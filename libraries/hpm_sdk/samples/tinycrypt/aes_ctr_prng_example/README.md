## Overview
***
aes_ctr_prng_example the example project shows the implementation of aes-ctr mode of equal symmetric encryption and decryption algorithm. In this project, the AES encryption algorithm ctr-prng mode is used to complete the module encryption and decryption test.

## Board Setting
***
No special settings

## Running the example
***
When the project runs correctly, and the serial port terminal will output the following information:
> tc_start() - Performing CTR-PRNG tests:
> All CTR PRNG tests succeeded!
> ===================================================================
> PASS - main.
> ===================================================================
> PROJECT EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL
