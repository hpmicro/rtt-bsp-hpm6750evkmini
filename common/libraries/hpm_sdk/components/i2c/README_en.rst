I2C Component
=============

Overview
--------

- The I2C component provides a higher-level API compared to the driver layer for configuring, initializing, and operating the I2C bus. It supports multiple I2C devices and offers both blocking and non-blocking data transfer functionalities. Below are the primary features of this component:

  - Multi-instance support
    - Supports multiple I2C instances (such as I2C0, I2C1, etc.), each with independent configuration parameters.
    - Manages configuration information for each I2C instance through the `hpm_i2c_context_t` structure, including address mode, speed mode, master/slave mode.

  - Blocking and non-blocking read/write operation interfaces
    - Supports both master and slave modes.
    - Provides non-blocking read/write functions.
    - Provides blocking read/write functions with timeout mechanisms to ensure timely error status returns in case of prolonged unresponsiveness.

Introduction to Relevant Enumerations and Structures
----------------------------------------------------

- Enumerations Introduction
  - I2C speed enumeration type, this enumeration defines three different I2C communication speed options: standard mode (100kHz), fast mode (400kHz), and fast plus mode (1MHz).

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef enum i2c_speed {
        i2c_speed_100khz,  /* Standard mode (100kHz) */
        i2c_speed_400khz,  /* Fast mode (400kHz) */
        i2c_speed_1Mhz,    /* Fast plus mode (1MHz) */
    } hpm_i2c_speed_t;

  - I2C communication mode enumeration type, defining two communication modes: master mode and slave mode.

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef enum i2c_communication_mode {
        i2c_master,
        i2c_slave,
    } hpm_i2c_communication_mode_t;

  - Address byte order enumeration type, this enumeration defines two different register address byte order options under master mode: little-endian and big-endian.

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef enum i2c_master_addr_endianness {
        i2c_master_addr_little_endian = 0,  /* Little endian */
        i2c_master_addr_big_endian,         /* Big endian */
    } hpm_i2c_master_addr_endianness_t;

- Structures Introduction

  - Initialization configuration structure, containing information such as communication mode, speed, whether to use 10-bit addressing, and slave device address.

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef struct i2c_initialize_config {
        hpm_i2c_communication_mode_t communication_mode; /* I2C communication mode */
        hpm_i2c_speed_t speed;                           /* I2C communication speed */
        bool is_10bit_addressing;                        /* Whether to use 10-bit addressing */
        uint8_t slave_address;                           /* Slave device address, only supported in slave mode */
    } hpm_i2c_initialize_config_t;

  - I2C context structure, containing members such as the I2C instance handle and initialization configuration. This structure needs to be defined in applications to save the I2C instance handle and initialization configuration.

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef struct i2c_context_t {
        I2C_Type *base;                                  /* Pointer to the I2C base register */
        hpm_i2c_initialize_config_t init_config;        /* Initialization configuration */
        hpm_i2c_master_addr_endianness_t addr_endianness;/* Master address endianness */
    } hpm_i2c_context_t;

API Call Flow Introduction
--------------------------

Defining an I2C Instance Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Define an instance of the `hpm_i2c_context_t` structure. For example, use the `i2c_context` instance variable in the sample.

Default I2C Instance Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the `hpm_i2c_get_default_init_context` API to initialize the `i2c_context` instance variable by assigning it to the `context` parameter of the API.

  - Prototype of `hpm_i2c_get_default_init_context` API:

  .. code-block:: c

    void hpm_i2c_get_default_init_context(hpm_i2c_context_t *context);

  - This function sets each member to default values:
    - 7-bit address mode
    - Master mode
    - 100kHz speed
    - Little-endian for address register transmission

I2C Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Call the `hpm_i2c_initialize` API to initialize the I2C. During this process, the parameters of the `i2c_context` instance variable are assigned to the `context` and take effect.

- Prototype of `hpm_i2c_initialize` API:

  .. code-block:: c

    void hpm_i2c_initialize(hpm_i2c_context_t *context);

- **Example**: Instantiate I2C0, set I2C0 to master mode, 1MHz speed, 7-bit address mode, and use big-endian for address register transmission.

  .. code-block:: c

    i2c_context.init_config.speed = i2c_speed_1Mhz;
    i2c_context.init_config.communication_mode = i2c_master;
    i2c_context.init_config.is_10bit_addressing = false;
    i2c_context.base = HPM_I2C0;
    i2c_context.addr_endianness = i2c_master_addr_big_endian;
    hpm_i2c_initialize(&i2c_context);

- **Example**: Instantiate I2C0, set I2C0 to slave mode, 1MHz speed, 10-bit address mode, with a slave device address of 0x16.

  .. code-block:: c

    i2c_context.init_config.speed = i2c_speed_1Mhz;
    i2c_context.init_config.communication_mode = i2c_slave;
    i2c_context.init_config.is_10bit_addressing = true;
    i2c_context.init_config.slave_address = 0x16;
    i2c_context.base = HPM_I2C0;
    hpm_i2c_initialize(&i2c_context);

DMA Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If using non-blocking read/write interfaces, this step is required.
- Use the `hpm_i2c_dma_mgr_install_callback` API to initialize DMA and register a callback function. When using non-blocking APIs for data transmission, this function must be called. If no callback function is needed, NULL can be passed as the callback argument.
- The main function of this function is to install the user-provided DMA transfer completion callback into the given I2C context. This ensures that after the DMA transfer completes, the system automatically calls the user's callback function for subsequent processing.

- Prototype of `hpm_i2c_dma_mgr_install_callback` API:

  .. code-block:: c

    hpm_stat_t hpm_i2c_dma_mgr_install_callback(hpm_i2c_context_t *context, hpm_i2c_dma_complete_cb complete)

  - Parameter Description:

      .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Parameter Name
          - Type
          - Description
        * - `context`
          - `hpm_i2c_context_t*`
          - Pointer to the I2C context structure containing configuration and status
        * - `complete`
          - `hpm_i2c_dma_complete_cb`
          - Pointer to the callback function for DMA transfer completion. Called when the DMA transfer ends.

  - Return Values:

    - `status_success`: Success

    - `status_invalid_argument`: Invalid argument

    - `status_fail`: Other errors

- **Example**: How to use the `hpm_i2c_dma_mgr_install_callback` function to register a callback function

  .. code-block:: c

    /* Define the callback function */
    void my_dma_complete_callback(uint32_t channel) {
        printf("DMA transfer on channel %d completed.\n", channel);
    }
    int main(void) {
        hpm_i2c_context_t i2c_context;
        /* Initialize I2C context... Not listed here */

        /* Register DMA transfer completion callback */
        hpm_stat_t result = hpm_i2c_dma_install_callback(&i2c_context, my_dma_complete_callback);

        if (result == status_success) {
            printf("Callback installed successfully.\n");
            /* Continue with DMA setup and start transmission... */
        } else {
            printf("Failed to install callback. Error code: %d\n", result);
        }

        /* TODO */
    }

Notes
-----

- Since the I2C component uses the DMA manager component, the DMA channel configurations are allocated by the DMA manager. When using DMA, ensure that the allocated DMA channels do not conflict with those used by the I2C component.
- The DMA channels used by the I2C component can be obtained by calling the `hpm_i2c_get_dma_mgr_resource` API.
